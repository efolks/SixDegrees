////STEPS FOR RANDOM ACTOR AS TARGET
// 1. FetchEndingActor, run same time as populateStartingActor
//       -maybe use that same function, get two actors
// 2. Have a boolean flag for random mode vs. kevin bacon mode
//       -pass in actor name(random or Bacon) to fetchFilmCast

//Additional: refactor all game status fields in initial state into one object

//CURRENT BUGS
// 1. looping to same actor after game conclusion
// 2. win and loss messages pop up after winning in last step
